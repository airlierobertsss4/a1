<h1>About CossiePlay</h1>
<p>CossiePlay is a family-run business and has been operating in Hulkstown since 2012. Outstanding custom-made costumes are created by the Cossieplay family. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from simple spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes can take between 1 and 50 weeks and coud cost between $10 and $10,000.
  We buy and sell second-hand costumes (<a href="prices.html">a price list is available here</a>) as well.
On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “CossiePlay Party” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party who takes requests and dancing is common (but not required).</p>

<p>Sally had started her first dress-making course and just six weeks in she was already designing and  sewing elaborate ball gowns and costumes that amazed her instructors. Just 10 years  later and she&rsquo;s making even more amazing creations for happy customers.</p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We encourage people of all types and sizes to unite in their favourite costumes at a cosparty event.  Our aim is to get a variety of people involved in Cosplay and combine as one through creative dress up. So costume up, get creative and come to the next cosparty.</p>
