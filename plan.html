<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Airlie Roberts<br>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> Cosplay allows people of all types and sizes to unite in their favourite costumes at a cosparty event.  Our aim is to get a variety of people involved in Cosplay and unite as one through creative dress up. So costume up, get creative and come to the next cosparty.</p>
<p>This mission statement will attract the targeted age groups. Telling the audience to dress up and come along to the cosparty is their invite. This will likely be the younger generations because the website is designed for them. This will benefit the client because people will know more about cosplay and what it entails and this was the clients desire.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The process by which the sites success will be evaulated is determined by how many people attend the monthly cosparties. Many people might be viewing the site but the success will be at the cosparties. This will also determine how many costumes are to be made. If the same amount of people attend the cosparties, the same amount of costumes will be made. The clients will be able to measure how many people will be attending before the parties through the amount of costumes they have to make. This is a clear strategy to accumulate numbers for the cosparties.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This site is intended for the target age group of ten years to twenty-five years. This particular age group was made based around the information provided by the clients. This web design will attract more high school kids and young adults rather than older men and women. Both genders are encouraged to visit this site. The design of this website will have particular characteristics that will attract the intended audience. This will include bright colours, medium to small text, mutliple pictures and more navigation. An older target audience such as fifty year olds are attracted by large, simple designs. This will be the opposite for this site. The age group allows for more complex design and typography.</p>
